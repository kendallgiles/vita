# Kendall Giles Vita

My current vita is composed in R Markdown from a template from [Steven Miller](https://github.com/svmiller). The vita depends on the r markdown templates and was compiled to pdf using RStudio.

An example of what this vita looks like when compiled to pdf is here: [Kendall Giles Vita](https://www.kendallgiles.com/kendall_giles_vita.pdf).


## ORIG

The original version was a LaTeX vita template, based on a template from [Kieran Healey](http://kjhealy.github.io/kjh-vita/).

That .tex uses xelatex to compile and it uses freely available fonts (eg Hoefler Text), at least if you are on OS X.
