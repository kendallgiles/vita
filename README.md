# vita

Kendall Giles

This is my LaTeX vita template, based on a template from [Kieran Healey](http://kjhealy.github.io/kjh-vita/).

This .tex uses xelatex to compile and it uses freely available fonts (eg Hoefler Text), at least if you are on OS X.

An example of what this vita looks like when compiled to pdf is here: [Kendall Giles Vita](https://www.kendallgiles.com/kendall_giles_vita.pdf).
